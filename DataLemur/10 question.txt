6. problem  : Coin Fairness Test
              Facebook Statistics Interview Question
que: Say you flip a coin 10 times and observe only one heads. What would be your null 
hypothesis and p-value for testing whether the coin is fair or not?

The null hypothesis for this test would be that the coin is fair, meaning that the probability of getting heads on any given flip is 0.5.

To calculate the p-value, we need to use a statistical test. In this case, we can use the binomial test to determine the probability of getting 1 or fewer heads out of 10 flips, assuming that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the coin is fair).

Using a binomial test with n = 10 and p = 0.5, we can calculate the probability of getting 1 or fewer heads:

P(X ≤ 1) = binom.cdf(1, 10, 0.5) = 0.0107

This means that the probability of observing 1 or fewer heads out of 10 flips, if the coin is fair, is 0.0107 or about 1.07%.

The p-value is the probability of getting a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed result, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. 
In this case, the observed result is 1 head out of 10 flips. Since the probability of getting 1 or fewer heads is 0.0107,
 which is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude 
that the coin is likely not fair.
