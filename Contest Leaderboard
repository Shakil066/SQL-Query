You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, 
then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  0 from your result.


SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, t1.total_score
  FROM (
        SELECT hacker_id, SUM(max_score) AS total_score
          FROM (
                SELECT hacker_id, MAX(score) AS max_score
                  FROM Submissions
                GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id
               ) t
        GROUP BY hacker_id
       ) t1
  JOIN Hackers h
    ON h.hacker_id = t1.hacker_id
 WHERE t1.total_score <> 0
 ORDER BY total_score DESC, hacker_id;
